            <h2>Morning: First Hour</h2>
            <p>When you wake up, your body is dehydrated after a night of rest. Start your day by drinking a glass of water to rehydrate. If you feel hungry, opt for a light meal such as a piece of fruit, a handful of nuts, or a small smoothie. Avoid heavy meals to allow your body to wake up gradually.</p>
