            <h2>How the Body Processes Food</h2>
            <p>When you eat, your body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used for energy, growth, and repair. This process begins in the mouth and continues through the digestive system, involving enzymes, acids, and chemical reactions. Each food group—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—is processed differently, providing unique benefits to the body.</p>

            <h2>Carbohydrates: Quick Energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Digestion:</strong> Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars (like glucose) starting in the mouth with the enzyme amylase in saliva. The process continues in the small intestine, where enzymes like maltase and lactase further break down complex carbs.</p>
            <p><strong>Absorption:</strong> Glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine and transported to cells for energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Energy Conversion:</strong> Glucose is converted into ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through cellular respiration, providing quick energy for the body. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles or converted into fat for long-term storage.</p>
            <p><strong>Chemical Release:</strong> Eating carbs triggers the release of insulin, a hormone that helps cells absorb glucose. This process also activates neurons in the brain, providing mental clarity and focus.</p>

            <h2>Proteins: Building Blocks of the Body</h2>
            <p><strong>Digestion:</strong> Protein digestion begins in the stomach, where hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin break proteins into smaller chains called peptides. In the small intestine, enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin further break peptides into amino acids.</p>
            <p><strong>Absorption:</strong> Amino acids are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine and transported to the liver, where they are distributed to cells for various functions.</p>
            <p><strong>Energy Conversion:</strong> While proteins are not the body’s primary energy source, amino acids can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis if needed. However, their primary role is to repair tissues, build muscle, and produce enzymes and hormones.</p>
            <p><strong>Chemical Release:</strong> Protein consumption stimulates the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which regulate mood and energy levels.</p>

            <h2>Fats: Long-Lasting Energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Digestion:</strong> Fat digestion begins in the small intestine, where bile from the liver emulsifies fats into smaller droplets. Enzymes like lipase break these droplets into fatty acids and glycerol.</p>
            <p><strong>Absorption:</strong> Fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed into the lymphatic system and eventually enter the bloodstream. They are transported to cells for energy or stored in adipose tissue for later use.</p>
            <p><strong>Energy Conversion:</strong> Fats provide a dense source of energy, yielding more ATP per gram than carbohydrates or proteins. They are especially important for sustained energy during prolonged activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Chemical Release:</strong> Fats play a role in hormone production, including the release of leptin, which regulates appetite, and cortisol, which helps manage stress.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Neurons and the Brain</h2>
            <p>The brain relies heavily on glucose from carbohydrates as its primary energy source. However, during fasting or low-carb diets, the brain can use ketones derived from fats as an alternative fuel. Neurons communicate through chemical signals, and the nutrients you consume influence this process. For example:</p>
            <p><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Boost serotonin production, improving mood and focus.</p>
            <p><strong>Proteins:</strong> Provide amino acids like tryptophan, which is a precursor to serotonin.</p>
            <p><strong>Fats:</strong> Support the myelin sheath, which protects neurons and enhances signal transmission.</p>

            <h2>How Long Does Digestion Take?</h2>
            <p>The time it takes to digest food varies by food group:</p>
            <p><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Simple carbs (like sugar) digest quickly, within 1-2 hours, while complex carbs (like whole grains) take 3-4 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>Proteins:</strong> Take 4-6 hours to digest, depending on the source (e.g., meat takes longer than plant-based proteins).</p>
            <p><strong>Fats:</strong> Take the longest to digest, often 6-8 hours or more, as they require emulsification and slower processing.</p>
