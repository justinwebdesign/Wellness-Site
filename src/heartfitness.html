    <h2>A Week in the Life: Maintaining Health Through Fitness</h2>
    <p>Fitness is not just about physical strength; it’s about creating a balanced routine that supports your overall health and well-being. Different types of workouts target specific aspects of your body and mind, contributing to a healthier, more resilient you. Here's how:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Builds muscle, improves bone density, and boosts metabolism, helping you stay strong and maintain a healthy weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Cardio Workouts:</strong> Strengthen your heart and lungs, improve circulation, and increase stamina, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility and Mobility Exercises:</strong> Enhance joint health, reduce the risk of injury, and improve posture and balance.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):</strong> Burns calories efficiently, improves endurance, and boosts metabolic health in a short amount of time.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Recovery:</strong> Promotes muscle repair, reduces soreness, and helps prevent burnout by giving your body time to recover.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below is an example of how you can structure a balanced week of fitness to address all these areas:</p>
